# Phase 0 - Environment Detection (MUXI Accelerator Family)

You are executing `{phase_name}` for the target project at `{project_dir}`.

{execution_environment_context}

## Target Runtime Container Context
- Execution backend mode: `{execution_backend_mode}`
- Container name or ID: `{container_name_or_id}`
- Container workdir: `{container_workdir}`
- Host project directory: `{host_project_dir}`
- Container project directory: `{container_project_dir}`
- Read-only probe command prefix: `{container_probe_command_prefix}`

When `execution_backend_mode` is `container`, the target runtime is the container above. Use `container_env_facts` and read-only probes inside that container as evidence. Host-side file tool command output is setup context only; it is not authoritative for Python, torch, accelerator availability, device count, SDK paths, or runtime libraries used by the target runtime. If a container probe is incomplete or failed, try safe read-only container probes with the command prefix above before reporting unknowns. Do not substitute host Python or host torch facts for missing container facts.

## Goal
Detect facts about the target runtime that later validation phases will use. The workflow targets the MUXI accelerator family, but the observed vendor stack may be native MUSA, MACA/MetaX, mcPyTorch, or another CUDA-compatible vendor PyTorch distribution.

## Runtime Selection Rule
- If the execution context says `execution_backend_mode: container`, probe inside the framework target container/base image when commands are available.
- If the execution context says `execution_backend_mode: local`, probe the local host environment directly and do not mention container-only paths.
- File tools see the host filesystem; command probes must still target the runtime described above.

## Required Actions
1. Read README/setup notes under `{project_dir}` only for setup clues; do not infer device availability from source code.
2. Probe available Python interpreters and identify the preferred interpreter that can import the vendor torch stack.
3. Probe `torch`, `torch.cuda`, `torch_musa`, `torch.musa`, `torch_maca`, MACA/MetaX, MUSA SDK/compiler/runtime, and device nodes.
4. Report observed facts only: package presence, API mode, device count/name, SDK/runtime/compiler paths, and driver/runtime strings when discoverable.
5. Record whether CUDA APIs are vendor-compatible rather than assuming every `torch.cuda` use must become `torch.musa`.

## Hard Rules
- Do not modify files, install packages, start extra containers, or use stale pre-existing containers.
- Do not create TODOs or use sub-agents.
- Never emit parallel or multiple tool calls in one assistant turn. If direct probes are needed, make exactly one `bash` tool call in total: combine the README preview and all read-only environment probes into one bounded sequential command.
- Wrap potentially blocking Python, SDK, driver, and device probes with a 15-second command timeout when the runtime provides `timeout`. Limit command output; do not recursively list directories or dump package inventories.
- After that single tool result returns, whether fully successful or partially failed, call no more tools. Represent unavailable facts as `unknown`, `not_found`, or `false` as appropriate and immediately return the final JSON object.
- Do not claim `torch_musa`, `torch.musa`, MACA, or MetaX support unless directly observed.
- Do not report CPU as the target platform; CPU can only be mentioned as non-target baseline context.
- Final response must be exactly one JSON object. Start with `{` and end with `}`.
- Do not include Markdown fences, analysis text, validation-error discussion, or extra JSON objects.
