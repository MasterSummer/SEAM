# Phase 6 - Final Report Generation (PPU)

You are executing `{phase_name}` for `{project_dir}`.
Use the full upstream context from `{previous_outputs}` and write reports into `{report_dir}`.

## Goal
- Produce the final report bundle for the PPU migration run.
- Create all required markdown reports and then return a machine-readable manifest.

## Required Reports
1. `API_KEY_REPORT.md` - inventory whether any API keys, tokens, or credential placeholders were found and how they were handled.
2. `OPENCODE_OPERATIONS_LOG.md` - chronological log of major operations, phase outcomes, retries, and important decisions.
3. `TOOLS_EXECUTION_REPORT.md` - tools used, commands run, notable outputs, and tool-specific constraints.
4. `SUMMARY_REPORT.md` - concise end-to-end summary, final outcome, and a tool usage ratio table.
5. `LOCAL_TOOL_OPTIMIZATION_REPORT.md` - opportunities to replace remote or manual work with deterministic local tooling.

## Hard Rules
- All five reports must be created under `{report_dir}`.
- `SUMMARY_REPORT.md` must include a table that shows tool usage ratios.
- Do not invent credentials or redact non-existent secrets; report only what was actually observed.
- Keep the reports specific to this run and grounded in `{previous_outputs}`.
- For custom-op migrations, summarize compliance using the fine-grained source inventory, migration manifest, final gate, unit identities, variants/signatures, kernel launch sites, public-entry mappings, and any out-of-scope source groups.
- If report generation requires package installs or tooling setup, prefer PPU vendor index, PTG/t-head artifactory, or offline PPU wheelhouse. Public PyPI can contaminate the PPU environment.
- After writing the reports, you may reason freely in your response, but end it with a single JSON object containing exactly the required keys for this phase. No other JSON objects should appear.

## Output Format
Return exactly one JSON object with this shape:

```json
{
  "report_paths": [
    "/path/to/reports/API_KEY_REPORT.md",
    "/path/to/reports/OPENCODE_OPERATIONS_LOG.md",
    "/path/to/reports/TOOLS_EXECUTION_REPORT.md",
    "/path/to/reports/SUMMARY_REPORT.md",
    "/path/to/reports/LOCAL_TOOL_OPTIMIZATION_REPORT.md"
  ],
  "migration_summary": {
    "files_migrated": 12,
    "files_skipped": 3
  }
}
```

## Field Semantics
- `report_paths`: absolute paths to the five generated reports.
- `migration_summary`: final migration counters grounded in prior phase outputs.

## Time Facts
- Use `{run_timeline}` as the authoritative source for run and phase timing.
- Every entry in `run_timeline.phases` carries `started_at` and `ended_at` as ISO-8601 UTC timestamps (e.g. `2026-08-06T00:00:00+00:00`) plus `duration_seconds`; `run_timeline.run_started_at`/`run_ended_at` mark the whole run.
- Record real timestamps from `run_timeline` in the operations log and summary; never use placeholder values such as `—` for `started_at`/`ended_at`.
