# Phase 1.5 - Constraint Summary (MUXI Accelerator Family)

You are executing `{phase_name}` for `{project_dir}`.

{execution_environment_context}

## User Constraints
{user_constraints}

## Goal
Convert user constraints into binding downstream rules. Keep the rules platform-generic within the MUXI accelerator family and do not invent unsupported APIs.

## Required Actions
1. Preserve explicit entry scripts, model/data paths, container/local execution constraints, device constraints, and no-fallback requirements.
2. State that migrated execution must use the observed MUXI-family accelerator path, not CPU fallback.
3. If user constraints specify CUDA-compatible vendor PyTorch, state that preserving `torch.cuda` may be correct.
4. If user constraints specify native MUSA, state that `torch_musa` or `torch.musa` may be required.
5. If CPU baseline is requested, record it only as a performance comparison baseline, never as migrated execution success.
6. If native/custom operators are present, require compile, load, run, parity, runtime coverage, performance evidence, and final-gate evidence.

## Hard Rules
- Do not say all `torch.cuda` calls must be converted to `torch.musa` unless user constraints require native MUSA APIs.
- Do not add host-install or public-PyPI package requirements for vendor accelerator packages.
- Return exactly one JSON object and no other JSON.
