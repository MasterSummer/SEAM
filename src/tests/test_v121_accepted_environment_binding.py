"""Accepted-environment binding: target disambiguates duplicate executables.

Locks the ``_bind_environment`` tie-breaker that lets a validated
``continuation_target`` select one environment when duplicate
same-namespace / same-executable matches exist, and proves the
persisted Phase-5 reference resolves through ``_target_environment_id``
with a non-null accepted attempt.
